# OpenSSL_for_Matlab

Our objective with this project is to port
key generation, signing and verification algorithms
from C/C++ to Matlab. They will be compared with
the equivalent algorithms present in the OpenSSL's 
C API in order to evaluate the feasability of this implementation.

## TO DO List
+ Functions in C/C++
  1. Generate asymmetric key pair (Angelo)
  2. Sign file with private key (Matheus)
  3. Verify signature with public key (Leandro)
+ Mex Files
+ Benchmarking
